            <p>
                Choosing a career path is one of the most important decisions we make. When I decided to pursue AI
                engineering at MCT Howest Kortrijk, it wasn't a random choice – it was the culmination of experiences,
                interests, and a vision for the future I want to help create.
            </p>

            <h2>The Spark</h2>
            <p>
                My interest in AI began when I first encountered a recommendation algorithm that seemed to understand my
                preferences better than I did myself. How could a machine predict what I'd enjoy? This simple question
                led me down a rabbit hole of machine learning, neural networks, and artificial intelligence.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started watching YouTube videos about AI, reading articles, and trying small coding projects. The more
                I learned, the more fascinated I became. AI wasn't just about algorithms – it was about creating systems
                that could learn, adapt, and solve problems in ways that were previously impossible.
            </p>

            <h2>The Real-World Impact</h2>
            <p>
                What really solidified my decision was seeing AI's potential to make a meaningful difference in people's
                lives:
            </p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> AI diagnosing diseases earlier and more accurately than traditional
                    methods</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Computer vision helping visually impaired people navigate the world
                </li>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> ML models optimizing energy consumption and predicting environmental
                    changes</li>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> Personalized learning systems adapting to each student's needs</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These weren't just theoretical possibilities – they were already happening. I wanted to be part of this
                transformation.
            </p>

            <h2>Why MCT Howest Kortrijk?</h2>
            <p>
                Choosing the right program was crucial. MCT Howest stood out for several reasons:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Practical Approach</h3>
            <p>
                The program emphasizes hands-on learning. It's not just theory – we build real projects, work with
                actual datasets, and solve practical problems. This learning style fits me perfectly.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Comprehensive Curriculum</h3>
            <p>
                The curriculum covers everything from fundamental mathematics and programming to advanced deep learning
                and deployment. It provides both breadth and depth.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Industry Connections</h3>
            <p>
                Howest has strong connections with tech companies, providing opportunities for internships and
                real-world projects. This bridge between education and industry is invaluable.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Research Opportunities</h3>
            <p>
                The program encourages research and innovation. Having the opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI
                problems excites me.
            </p>

            <h2>The Intersection of My Interests</h2>
            <p>
                AI engineering perfectly combines several of my passions:
            </p>

            <h3>Problem-Solving</h3>
            <p>
                I've always loved puzzles and challenges. AI engineering is essentially solving complex problems – how
                to make machines learn, generalize, and make intelligent decisions.
            </p>

            <h3>Mathematics and Logic</h3>
            <p>
                The mathematical foundations of AI – linear algebra, calculus, probability – fascinate me. Understanding
                how elegant mathematical concepts translate into powerful algorithms is deeply satisfying.
            </p>

            <h3>Creativity</h3>
            <p>
                Many people think engineering is purely logical, but AI requires tremendous creativity. Designing neural
                network architectures, feature engineering, and problem formulation all require creative thinking.
            </p>

            <h3>Sports and Human Performance</h3>
            <p>
                My interest in soccer and physiotherapy isn't separate from my AI career – it's complementary. AI
                applications in sports analytics and injury prevention represent a perfect blend of my interests.
            </p>

            <h2>The Challenges I Expected</h2>
            <p>
                I went into this field with my eyes open to the challenges:
            </p>

            <h3>Rapid Change</h3>
            <p>
                AI evolves incredibly fast. What's cutting-edge today might be outdated in six months. This requires
                continuous learning, which I see as exciting rather than daunting.
            </p>

            <h3>Mathematical Complexity</h3>
            <p>
                Understanding the mathematics behind AI algorithms requires significant effort. I knew this would be
                challenging but also rewarding.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                AI has tremendous power, which comes with responsibility. Issues like bias, privacy, and fairness
                require careful consideration. I'm committed to developing AI ethically.
            </p>

            <h3>High Competition</h3>
            <p>
                AI is a hot field, attracting talented people worldwide. Standing out requires dedication, unique
                perspectives, and continuous improvement.
            </p>

            <h2>My Goals in AI</h2>
            <p>
                I have specific goals that drive my studies:
